## Disclaimer
THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IT IS. YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING HAPPENS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM.<p>
If you miss some important calls because of my program, that's on you, not me.

## Why make this program?
I have been annoyed by various agents calling my home for the last 5 years. They all claimed to be about my "property" in Mexico!? And they all tried to convince me that I could sell that property for thousands of dollars. Over the years, I kept sending Do-Not-Call agency hundreds of complains. Yet those telemarketers just kept on calling. It seems there will never be an end to this enormous waste of my time.<p>
I got really fed up with this. Definitely need some tool to fight back. After just a little research I found out that I was not the only one. There are millions of people who are suffering the same bad experience just like me. I wonder why no one is able to stop them. Why the government just let this kind of things happen. <p>
There is a very interesting Raspberry App called "It's Lenny" https://lennytroll.com . It can trick those telemarketers into talking to a machine and waste their time. I love this idea! Yet it's very limited, not so easy to setup, so I think maybe it's time for a little different favor. As everyone is much more familiar with Windows. Why not make a Windows-based program to do similar things? <p>
## How to run this program?
The details are in the Wiki. Here is just a brief introduction:
* You need a modem that supports voice features, ideally with Conexant chipset.
* You need to have a phone line that supports caller id feature.
* You need an old computer or laptop to run this program. You need at least Windows XP.
* Once it starts monitoring your call, you can set the rules to apply to certain numbers. It will automatically pick up the phone calls that fits the pattern.
## What are those rules?
* White List. It will be top priority. Those numbers will be left alone and let you pick up the call.
* Fake Fax. The program will pick up the call and pretend to be a fax machine.
* Disconnect. The program will pickup the call, keep silence for 20 secends then hang up.
* Warning.  The program will pick up the call, play a voice message and warn the caller do not call this number then hang up. The voice is provided by Microsoft Azure.
* It's Lenny. This feature is not yet working, so it's not in the first release. I am working on this for the next version.
* ... There will be more rules in the future. Give me time.
