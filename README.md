# Spam Call Filter
Use a voice modem to fend off those nasty tele-marketers.<br>
Take a look at the Wiki to see the preview of my program.<br>

## Disclaimer
THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IT IS. YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING HAPPENS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM.<p>
If you miss some important calls because of my program, that's on you, not me.
## Why make this program?
I have been annoyed by various agents calling my home for the last 5 years. They were all claimed to be calling about my "property" in Mexico !? And they all tried to convince me that I could sell that property for thousands of dollars. I kept sending Do-Not-Call agency hundreds of complains. Yet those tele-marketers just kept on calling. It seems there will never be an end to my suffering.<p>
Therefore I got really fed up for this. I need some tool to fight back. After just a little research I found out that I was not the only one. There are millions of people who are suffering the same bad experience just like me. I wonder why no one is trying to stop them.<p>
There is a very interesting app call "It's Lenny". It can trick those tele-marketers into talking to a machine. I love this idea! Yet it's very limited and I think it's time for a little update.<p>
Of course you can always transfer your call to a "It's Lenny" hot line, but I think it's much more fun to run one myself.
## How to run this program?
* You need a USB modem that supports voice features, ideally with Conexant chipset.
* You need to have a phone line that supports caller id feature.
* You need an old computer or laptop to run this program. You need at least Windows XP.
* Once it starts monitoring your call, you can set the rules to apply to certain numbers. It will automatically pick up the phone calls that fits the pattern.
## What are those rules?
* White List. It will be top priority. Those numbers will be left alone and let you pick up the call.
* Fake Fax. The program will pick up the call and pretend to be a fax machine.
* Warning.  The program will pick up the call, play a voice message and warn the caller do not call this number then hang up.
* It's Philip. This is my favorite. Inspired by "It's Lenny", it will play my voices ( or you can record your own voice) in a loop. Fool those tele-marketers into thinking they are talking to a real person. Those voices are in a strict format: unsign wav, 8bit, 8000hz and mono. You can use free programs like Audacity to convert your own recording to this format. It's not hard.
* ... There will be more rules in the future. Give me time.

## Progress
Right now it's still in very early stages. No release yet. When the first version is done you will see it on the right under "Releases".
